      This week I spent my time on many smaller parts of the project. First, I designed and created a mockup UI in a program called Balsamiq Wireframes. Furthermore, I rigged a new high quality vehicle model with Edy's Physics which we would use as the vehicle for a user to control. Lastly, I started working on a Terrain editor. I was both able to use scripts to modify the 3D terrain, and also made it so you can import data from OpenStreetMaps to blender, and then from there import it as an asset to Unity. This allows us to take real life 3D map data and display it in Unity.
