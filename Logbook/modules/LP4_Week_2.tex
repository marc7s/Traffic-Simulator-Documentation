    \begin{itemize}
      \item \performance{\martin}{
        This week I mainly worked with UI. Making it scale better and implementing more functionality/statistics.
      }
      
      \item \performance{\felix}{
        Mainly bug fixes, refactoring and integrating my code with other code.
      }
      
      \item \performance{\hannes}{
        This week I mainly refactored code, fixed bugs and worked on adding lamp posts.
      }
      
      \item \performance{\marcus}{
        I mainly worked on yielding in intersections to avoid collisions. The traffic lights help, but collisions can still occur as cars will cross each others paths when turning, so even with traffic lights we need yielding for the cars to behave properly.
      }
      
      \item \performance{\jakob}{
        Most of my time this week was spent on reworking the car spawner. Because of the new features, mainly intersections, that have been added since I wrote the original car spawner, it needed to be fixed. So I rewrote the code and logic, to exclude spawning cars in intersections etc. I also wrote some code to allow cars to be controlled by time events by the time manager, which can later be used to develop busses and other scheduled vehicles.
      }
