        As was decided during the weeks sprint planning meeting, the main focus was bug/error fixing. While solving bugs I created a custom editor for our AutoDrive script, which allows the user to update settings live while the simulation is running. This solved a bug which revolved around switching the navigation path/target on/off while the simulation was running. Another bug I started working on was our CarSpawner script which needed to be updated since I wrote it a couple weeks ago. This is because of our additional features of the simulator, that did not exist when I wrote it originally.
