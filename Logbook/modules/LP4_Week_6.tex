        This week I worked on POI navigation, Intersection mesh, OSM and UV setup for roadside parking.
      }
      
      \item \performance{\marcus}{
        This week revolved around trying to get many different parts working together, so I did work in several different areas. I focused on bus stop and parking POIs, and I also added support for intersections with yielding signs instead of traffic lights.

      \item \performance{\jakob}{
        This week I worked on multiple different areas of the simulation. I finished the roof algorithm for OSM using an ear clipping method. I added a day/night cycle to the simulation to improve it's reflection on real-life. I rigged all the new vehicles with brake lights and indicators. Lastly, I started designing the world for the Masthugget build.
