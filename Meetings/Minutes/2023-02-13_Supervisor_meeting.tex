    \section{Notes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The group should discuss the reason behind switching away from Road Architect in the final thesis.
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Discussion}
        Quick discussion about one of the group members leaving the project, and how we would divide our group for the 2 presentations.

        The group decided to switch from using the Road Architect asset to instead creating our own. The reasoning behind this choice, was that it would act unstable in some scenarios.

        Lastly, the group informed the supervisor about the success in purchasing assets and implementing them into the Unity project.

    \section{Decisions}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item No decisions were made during the meeting.
