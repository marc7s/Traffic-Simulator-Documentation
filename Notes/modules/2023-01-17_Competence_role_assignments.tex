A list of competences among the members was created, with roles in Discord assigned according to this list. The goal of these roles are to know who you should ask for assistance when you need help in different areas. With the Discord roles, members can ping a specific role which sends a notification to all those who are proficient in that area so they can assist.

This list is compiled below, but aims to be updated later in the project as we gain new competences and improve our skills.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Git:} \marcus \and \hannes

    \item \textbf{Trello:} \felix \and \marcus
    \item \textbf{LaTeX:} \marcus
