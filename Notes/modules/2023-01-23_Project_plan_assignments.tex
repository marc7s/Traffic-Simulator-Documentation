Identified potential problems that will be relevant for the project plan report: Collaboration, General Unity Development, Traffic Flow Modelling, UI, Performance Optimization, and Testing.

We decided to utilize GitHub pull requests for our code reviews. We will try to let every pull request be open for review for anybody but might later on go with a designated reviewer for each developer. 

GitHub issues will also be used for bug reporting.
