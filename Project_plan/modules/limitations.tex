To limit the scope of the simulation tool, it was decided to set some boundaries on what the tool should and should not include. 

To begin with, the tool will only simulate vehicles such as cars and buses since including pedestrians was deemed too far fetched because of the added complexity and their small impact on traffic. In addition, there was a worry about the tools overall performance with both vehicles and pedestrians moving around.
