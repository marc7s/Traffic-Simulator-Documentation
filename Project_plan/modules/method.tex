The tool will be developed in Unity, a cross platform game engine. In order to collaborate, the project will be stored in a Git repository. This also allows for version control and the opportunity to revert to previous versions for identification of bugs or if something would corrupt. Since a Unity project does not consist of pure text or code files, additional steps have to be taken in order to avoid merge conflicts or other issues that can arise when collaborating in a version control system. Therefore each developer will have their own scene in Unity and updates to the project will mainly take place as changes to \glossaryword{prefab}{prefabs}, which are reusable objects that can be used as templates.

\subsection{Testing}
Due to the challenging nature of validating and testing agent-based simulation, our main method of making sure our software is working correctly will be in the form in-house user testing. A set amount of hours will be allocated each week once testing becomes relevant where developers will explore and observe the simulation under different parameters. The goal of this will be to identify any faulty system behaviour or usability issues, and also gather valuable feedback on the overall design and functionality of the simulation.
