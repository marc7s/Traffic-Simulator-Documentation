The tool will be developed in Unity, a cross platform game engine. In order to collaborate, the project will be stored in a Git repository. This also allows for version control and the opportunity to revert to previous versions for identification of bugs or if something would corrupt. Since a Unity project does not consist of pure text or code files, additional steps have to be taken in order to avoid merge conflicts or other issues that can arise when collaborating in a version control system. Therefore each developer will have their own scene in Unity and updates to the project will mainly take place as changes to \glossaryword{prefab}{prefabs}, which are reusable objects that can be used as templates.
