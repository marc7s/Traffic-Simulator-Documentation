The purpose of this project is to create a traffic simulation tool that will allow the user to design a road-network, and see real-time statistics about its traffic flow and environmental impact. In addition, the user should be able to manipulate different aspects of the simulation such as the amount of cars.

 By changing some of the aspects in the simulation, the user will be able to see whether their design improves a road-network, which can result in less traffic congestion and a smaller environmental impact.
