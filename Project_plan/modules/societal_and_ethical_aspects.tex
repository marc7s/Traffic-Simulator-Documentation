Ethical aspects can be broken down into two parts: Aspects related to the method of the project, and possible consequences for users of the final product and society as a whole. There are no obvious ethical issues related to the method of our project. For example, there is no use of personal data, no significant security risks, and no use of questionable technology or software.

The finished product however, brings some interesting aspects to light. One of the goals of this project is to create a tool that can be used by architects, engineers and decision makers working on transport systems by giving them insights about efficiency and emissions. Therefore, we have to look at how our design choices could affect those users in their decisions about transport systems. In regards to this, the most important thing is to be aware of our simulation's limitations as a way to model real life systems.
