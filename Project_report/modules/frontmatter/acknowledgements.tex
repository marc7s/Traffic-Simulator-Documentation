\section*{Acknowledgements}
    We would like to express our gratitude towards our supervisor, Natasha Bianca Mangan, who provided great guidance through our development process. With her experience, she helped us with specialised advice in the development software used in the project. In addition, her feedback for this report was invaluable.

    Special thanks go to our testers, without whom our tool would not have become as intuitive to use or as accessible for users without extensive experience in transportation planning. With their feedback we were able to improve the user experience.
