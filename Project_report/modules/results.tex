    \subsection{Test subject 1}
        The first test subject had prior experience in a transportation planning software called PTV Visum, which is the worlds most popular software of its kind when it comes to aiding strategic and operative decisions \cite{visum}. Compared to Visum which is set in 2D, the user felt that our tool provided more context and that it was easier to understand the road network. The test subject pointed out that it was easier to see the road connections and intersections in our tool. However, Visum offered a better view for larger networks. The user appreciated the simulation of individual vehicles compared to Visum which displays traffic as a number of vehicles per road, and felt that it improved the intuition for smaller networks. Being able to see statistics related to individual vehicles was also pointed out as useful. The test subject felt our tool lacked some customisability that Visum offers, where you can change parameters such as road capacity that affect the simulation. The user mentioned that Visum had a learning curve to understand the buttons and features, which was easier to do in our tool although it does not offer as granular control over the traffic as Visum does. The test subject was not able to use the public transportation feature as it was not done at the time of testing, but expressed interest in it and thought that it was a great idea that Visum lacked. Colour coding the roads based on the congestion level was being implemented at the time of testing, and was something the subject mentioned would be helpful.

        The test subject felt that our tool was easy to understand, and significantly simpler to use for presentation purposes than Visum, which was said to be more technical and harder to understand at first glance than our tool. The user had used Visum to demonstrate their solution, and said that it was difficult to find a good way of visualising and presenting it. It was also thought that our tool would be useful for education purposes, and that it would fit well for teaching different concepts in transportation planning as it is intuitive and easy to understand what is going on.

        Apart from the functionality compared to Visum, the test subject also had feedback regarding the UI. The user thought that it was confusing that there were separate buttons for the statistics depending on if it was showing individual statistics for a vehicle or aggregated statistics for the entire road network. It was also expressed that it would be easier to navigate using the mouse for adjusting the camera rotation and pitch while keeping the keyboard for moving the camera around, and that it felt slow to move around a larger network.
