\section{Cubic Bézier Curve}
A cubic Bézier curve is a parametric curve defined by four control points. The four control points define a smooth, continuous curve.

\end{figure}

The cubic Bézier curve can be defined by the formula\cite{Cubic-Bézier-Curves}: \[P(t) = (1-t)^3P_0 + 3t(1 - t)^2P_1 + 3t^2(1 - t)P_2 + t^3P_3, 0 \le t \le 1. \]
Cubic Bézier curves have some basic properties.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1. P\textsubscript{0} and P\textsubscript{3} are on the curve
    \item 2. The curve is continuous, infinitely differentiable, and the second derivatives are continuous.
    \item 3. The tangent line to the curve at the point P\textsubscript{0} is the line P\textsubscript{0}P\textsubscript{1}. The tangent to the
curve at the point P\textsubscript{3} is the line P\textsubscript{2}P\textsubscript{3}.
    \item 4. Both P\textsubscript{1} and P\textsubscript{2} are on the curve only if the curve is linear.
\end{itemize}

\section{Composite Bézier curve}
A composite Bézier curve is a spline made out of Bézier curves. The series of bezier curves are joined together end to end with the start point of one curve coinciding with the end point of the other curve.

\section{A* Algorithm}
A* is an algorithm widely used for path finding and graph traversal \cite{A-Star-Algorithm}. Given a start, and end node in a weighted graph, the algorithm will find the shortest path between the nodes.
