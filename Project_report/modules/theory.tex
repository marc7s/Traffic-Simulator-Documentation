This section lays the theoretical foundation for the essential concepts that underpin the implementation of our agent-based traffic model in Unity. It covers a variety of topics, including specific mathematical functions, code design principles, pathfinding algorithms, and the theoretical aspects of software development project management frameworks. By establishing a solid understanding of these core concepts, readers will be better prepared to grasp the intricacies of the traffic simulation presented later in this thesis.

\section{Scrum and Agile Software Development}
    Agile Software Development is a software development framework which emphasises vertical development cycles, where software should be delivered frequently in atomic slices to enable quick feedback and high flexibility with regards to how the product develops. When developing complex products, and especially when the development team has not worked on anything similar to the current developed product, implementing an agile framework can be particularly important. Since features are delivered in small complete chunks, it minimises the investment risk compared to a more horizontal feature development.
