\section{Scrum and Agile Software Development}
    Agile Software Development is a software development framework which emphasizes vertical development cycles, where software should be delivered frequently in atomic slices to enable quick feedback and high flexibility with regards to how the product develops. When developing complex products, and especially when the development team has not worked on anything similar to the current developed product, implementing an Agile framework can be particularly important. Since features is delivered in small complete chunks, this minimizes the investment risk compared to a more horizontal feature development.
