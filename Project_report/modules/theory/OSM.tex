\section{OpenStreetMap}
    OpenStreetMap, or OSM for short, is a free database which contains geographical data \cite{open-street-map}. The database is maintained and updated by volunteers. Volunteers can collect data about geographical areas and add to the database for everyone to use. Data about features such as roads, railroads, buildings, trees, etc and their properties exist. OSM can be used to create maps of locations without having to gather data.
