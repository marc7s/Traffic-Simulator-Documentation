\section{OpenStreetMap}
    OpenStreetMap, or OSM for short, is a free and open-source database which contains geographical data \cite{open-street-map}. The database is maintained and updated by volunteers. Volunteers can collect data about geographical areas and add to the database for everyone to use. The data includes features such as roads, railroads, buildings and trees as well as their properties. OSM can be used to generate environments based on existing locations.
