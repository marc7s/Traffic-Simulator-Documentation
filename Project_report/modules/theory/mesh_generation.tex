\section{Procedural mesh generation}\label{mesh-generation}
    All physical objects in Unity have an associated mesh, i.e. their surfaces. A cube for example can be thought of as having a mesh consisting of 6 different surfaces. In computer graphics, a triangle mesh is a type of mesh where the surfaces are created through a set of points, called vertices. These vertices are then joined together by a set of triangles. Returning to the cube example, a cube in its simplest form would have 12 triangles and 8 vertices. The eight vertices are at the corners of the cube. Each face of the cube has the shape of a square, which can be created with two triangles, hence double the amount of triangles as square faces.

    Procedural mesh generation is the act of generating these meshes through a script. This is done mainly for the roads, where the mesh has to be rebuilt whenever the road is changed. The road meshes are generated along the BÃ©zier curves that define them, creating the vertices from points offset along the normal of the curve.
